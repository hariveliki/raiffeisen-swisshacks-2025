**1 - Real Estate Search**

*Create an agent driven chat-based app for customers to input preferences and/or images and search and display matching new listings.*

Image search as a basis ("image 2 criterias"):

Variant (a): Upload a picture of a house, that best matches your own wishes. Based on this, the best possible offers are sought. In addition, possible secondary features can be derived from the image content (and/or its connotation) and suggested for selection, for example:

- Farmhouse => next farm shop, Steiner school ?
- Bauhaus style => next theater, cinema ?
- Penthouse in high-rise building => Urban / Agglomeration ?
- etc.

Variant (b): Extended image search, d.h. multiple images can be uploaded to narrow down the search context: house, school, supermarket, lake, forest, sports stadium, etc.

===> Search Web for real estate objects based on created criteria set (e.g. use APIs from real estate portals)

**2 - Retirement planning**

*Enhance a chatbot to provide retirement advice, projections and product recommendations.*

Build an interactive determination of interests and preferences to create a holistic model of life planning. It could look like this:

- First, 1 to n preferences (hobbies, lifestyle) must be specified or selected.
- From this, further possible preferences are derived and offered for selection.
- From the respective state of the preference list, a sketch for a life model is formulated, e.g.  Living in rented accommodation in the upscale segment, two cinema-theater visits per month, 4-8 long-distance trips p.a.

The basic costs (living, food, hobbies, health, etc.) are calculated for this life model and compared with the available funds.
Based on this, suitable investment strategies are proposed and/or projections based on the current savings.
