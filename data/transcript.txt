Chris, great to speak again. I wanted to start with a quick portfolio update. Overall performance declined this quarter due to the tariff situation, but it is outperforming the benchmark. We see some challenges in the tech sector with interest rate expectation and potential increased tariffs. Thanks for the update. I'm a little concerned about the tariff situation too, but I believe the technology sector will always grow, regardless of what the experts say. Oh, by the way, how was the wedding on the honeymoon last month? I hope Simone and you had a great time in Maldives. And anything else new going on in your life here in Zurich? Yes, we finally got married and the Maldives were breathtaking. Absolutely stunning. And yes, actually, Simone is pregnant. We're having a baby. We're super excited, but to be honest, a little overwhelmed. We're currently in an apartment and we're thinking about buying a house now. Oh, that's great. Given this, it may be a wise time to reevaluate your investment strategy and plan for your liquidity needs for a home purchase. And just so you know, we have multiple mortgages offering when you are ready. We can help with a mortgage pre-approval as well. Yes, please. That would be a huge help. Also, I have another need. Do you have any other solutions for college expense planning? We'll only accept sending our precious and gifted child to Harvard, which is very expensive. I understand, but no, we don't currently have any dedicated solution on college planning. But let's schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss two other topics. Does Monday afternoon work? Monday works perfectly. Thank you, Garrett, for being the world's best advisor. You're welcome, Haris. And thank you for being the world's best client.
