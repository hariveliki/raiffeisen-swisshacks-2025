Investor Profile,Financial Life Stage,Career Development,"The career development phase normally occurs during the 35–50 age range and is often a time of specific skill development within a given field, upward career mobility, and income growth. This phase often includes accumulation for the children’s college educations as well as expenditures for college. Concern intensifies about retirement income planning and financial independence. Higher earners will begin building wealth beyond education and retirement objectives and may make large purchases, such as a vacation home, or travel extensively. Retirement saving tends to increase at a more rapid pace during this phase compared with the early career phase."
